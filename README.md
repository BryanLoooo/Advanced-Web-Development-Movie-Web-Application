# üé¨ Movie Web Application ‚Äî Django RESTful API

A RESTful web service built with **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)** for managing movies and their metadata.  
This project demonstrates end-to-end data management, including CRUD operations, data preprocessing, normalization, and testing for a clean, scalable movie database.

## üß© Overview

The **Movie Web Application** provides API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting movie data, including related genres, stars, and directors.  
It uses a relational database schema normalized up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to ensure data integrity and minimal redundancy.  

The system also supports bulk data import from cleaned CSV files and includes comprehensive unit testing to validate reliability and performance.
